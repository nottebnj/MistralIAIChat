# Mistral AI Chat Client

Basic chat client for Mistral AI using Streamlit.
Strongly inspired on https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/tutorials/build-conversational-apps
Basic guest only authentication using streamlit-authenticator to avoid over-usage.

Mistral AI api-key and guest password defined as Streamlit secret.

ToDo:
1. Put authentication DB in e.g. Firebase and handle multiple user.
2. Save discussion history in e.g. Firebase
